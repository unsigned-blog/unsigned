[//]: # (Universities Are Trash)

I'm getting so tired of Universities and their bullshit tuition costs. I went to university a long time ago and luckily walked away with no debt. That's not the case for most people today.

The economics will balance out eventually. Universities will cost so much in the future that not everyone will be able to afford them nor want to become an indentured servant to their loaner.

It's funny that the feminist movement has pushed more women than men into universities. It's 56% female and 44% male today. Women are walking away with tons of debt only to realize that 5-6 years later they need to pop out a kid otherwise double down on their career. Either way it doesn't end well (in debt or familyless) It has amplified hypergamy and the mess women are in today with gender and relationship dynamics.

Eventually gender dynamics will balance out too... It will take a bit longer. Maybe 100 years. Maybe by then there's some other life changing bullshit that happens which alters the course of human life and it doesn't even matter. Oh well.
