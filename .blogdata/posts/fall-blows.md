[//]: # (Fall Blows)

I was going to try and tell the whole story from where I thought my life derailed but trying to cover 15 years of my life isn't practical or healthy. I'm going to focus on what's going on today.

There is someone I am in love with but she doesn't know. Maybe she does, it's just that I haven't said those words to her. Every time we get closer she pulls away so I'm scared that if I told her it wouldn't go well. I'm going to wait and see what happens. It's so fragile that I actually have to ignore it for now. Trying to distract myself. I will probably start dating other women to fill the void of being alone. I know that's not the smartest thing to do since I am in love with someone else but the loneliness is crushing me. I have a feeling she's dating other guys too, so I'm going to justify it with that, and try not think about it. Plus it's been a long time since I got laid and doing that again would be great.

In other news, I am looking into some cool places to visit over the winter. I haven't been snowboarding in 15 years (coincidence?) so that's an option. Thinking Vail because I have a friend who works there, Lake Tahoe, or Anchorage.

Today I am looking forward to picking up my kids from school and having dinner with them. That's part of the deal, for now. Wednesday's for dinner and every other weekend... working on getting more time with them but it hasn't been going so well. Getting divorced sucks!
