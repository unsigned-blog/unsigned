[//]: # (Fuck Gender Inclusive Pronouns)

The first time I saw this I was baffled and had to look it up... Upon which I determined that it is the stupidest fucking thing I have seen since the paper-straw movement.

I'm going to call you whatever pronoun I want. You don't determine what you're called by me. If I want to call you a flaming faggot I will.

If you add this to your profile the only thing it signals is that you are stupid and easily manipulated.

That is all.
