I'm just going to leave this right here.

One thing to note, Barbara Walters was married four times. Her marriages lasted 2, 13, 3, and 6 years each. Connery was married twice. His marriages lasted 11 and 45+ years. The + is because he died while married and I can only imagine it would have last until the end of time.

Barbara you deserve a bitch slap for this one!
