[//]: # (The US is About to Get Fucked)

Sometimes I watch [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ctsJZ2aD1nCexfqj342NQ). It's mostly about MGTOW and I watch it even though I'm not MTGOW (obviously if you've read any of my previous posts), but the guy thinks rationally and I like getting a wide perspective of worldviews in order to form my own. Recently he posted [this video](https://youtu.be/zBPJT4z9I3w?t=300) in which he mentions [an article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/highly-indebted-zombie-companies-control-more-than-2-million-us-jobs.html) that has nothing to do with gender but rather the US economy. 2.2 million jobs is only 1.4% of the total number of jobs but I think there's more to it than just jobs. We don't know how much debt zombie companies are in for. And the other thing is the stock market - how can it have soared so high in year with high unemployment and reduced consumer spending?

A crash is coming in 2021! I don't know how bad it will be exactly but something seems completely fucked up. I can already see it coming for the company I work for. They're doomed! I can see it in the stimulus checks we're all getting. Better hold on to that cash! When shit hits the fan real estate is going to be cheap as hell (I'm planning on capitalizing on it). Unemployment rates will get worse and continue getting worse for a couple of years. The US will go into a civil war. It will only end with many deaths and government + media reform. No one trusts politicians and they can't keep up with modern day technology or civil rights issues. The media is out of control. The rich will get super-rich and then dip out. The Great Depression part 2 is about to drop.
