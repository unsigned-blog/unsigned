[//]: # (I'm back motherfuckers)

It's been a long time. The world has changed a lot. It's gotten more stupid. That's partly why I'm back.

I rarely watch the news but I saw a pandemic update on YouTube today that I decided to watch because it was only 2 minutes long. They flashed some numbers up on the screen...

* 13.3 million Americans got COVID
* 266 thousand have died from it

Sounds scary right?

Not really. I looked up the US population which is 328.2 million. That means only 4% of the US got COVID. Only 2% of the people that got it died which is .08% of the US population. It's mostly old people and unhealthy people who die.

So what the fuck is everyone scared of? Live a healthy life you dumb shits. You can't stop time or aging. Fuck all of you mask wearing ninjas!

I hear there is a vaccine coming out. Actually there are a couple of them because each pharma company is developing their own. What kind of moron would take that shit? My ex got multiple sclerosis from a tetanus shot. Fuck that. I'll wait till version 5000 of the CVOID vaccine comes out before I take it.

I have more shit to say about the world but I'm going to save it for another day now that I'm back. Enjoy!
