[//]: # (Gender Equality)

I saw a video the other day on gender equality in sports where a coach was talking about reasons why women should have the same opportunities as men. Not only in sports but in the workplace and politics. I am pretty tired of this bullshit. I'm all for equal rights but there are reasons why women aren't equal to men.

I was prepared to write a long post about this but... It all boils down to *sex*. If women want to be truly equal then science will have to find a way to replace sex and companionship completely. It would have to be better than it is today, which will be _extremely hard_ to do. Did I just make a pun? ...anyways, good luck with that, Science!
