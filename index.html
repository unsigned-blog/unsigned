    <h2>Fuck Gender Inclusive Pronouns</h2>
    <time datetime="1/24/2021 5:33:20 AM +00:00">Published on Sun, 24 Jan 2021 05:33:20 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p><img src="/images/she_her_profile_bullshit.png" alt="Image of Gender inclusive pronouns found on LinkedIn profiles" /></p>
<p>The first time I saw this I was baffled and had to look it up... Upon which I determined that it is the stupidest fucking thing I have seen since the paper-straw movement.</p>
<p>I'm going to call you whatever pronoun I want. You don't determine what you're called by me. If I want to call you a flaming faggot I will.</p>
<p>If you add this to your profile the only thing it signals is that you are stupid and easily manipulated.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>

    <h2>Universities Are Trash</h2>
    <time datetime="1/24/2021 5:29:35 AM +00:00">Published on Sun, 24 Jan 2021 05:29:35 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I'm getting so tired of Universities and their bullshit tuition costs. I went to university a long time ago and luckily walked away with no debt. That's not the case for most people today.</p>
<p>The economics will balance out eventually. Universities will cost so much in the future that not everyone will be able to afford them nor want to become an indentured servant to their loaner.</p>
<p>It's funny that the feminist movement has pushed more women than men into universities. It's 56% female and 44% male today. Women are walking away with tons of debt only to realize that 5-6 years later they need to pop out a kid otherwise double down on their career. Either way it doesn't end well (in debt or familyless) It has amplified hypergamy and the mess women are in today with gender and relationship dynamics.</p>
<p>Eventually gender dynamics will balance out too... It will take a bit longer. Maybe 100 years. Maybe by then there's some other life changing bullshit that happens which alters the course of human life and it doesn't even matter. Oh well.</p>

    <h2>Sean Connery is the Fucking MAN!</h2>

        <p>I'm just going to leave this right here.</p>

<p>One thing to note, Barbara Walters was married four times. Her marriages lasted 2, 13, 3, and 6 years each. Connery was married twice. His marriages lasted 11 and 45+ years. The + is because he died while married and I can only imagine it would have last until the end of time.</p>
<p>Barbara you deserve a bitch slap for this one!</p>

    <h2>The US is About to Get Fucked</h2>
    <time datetime="1/5/2021 3:16:55 AM +00:00">Published on Tue, 05 Jan 2021 03:16:55 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sometimes I watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ctsJZ2aD1nCexfqj342NQ">this YouTube channel</a>. It's mostly about MGTOW and I watch it even though I'm not MTGOW (obviously if you've read any of my previous posts), but the guy thinks rationally and I like getting a wide perspective of worldviews in order to form my own. Recently he posted <a href="https://youtu.be/zBPJT4z9I3w?t=300">this video</a> in which he mentions <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/highly-indebted-zombie-companies-control-more-than-2-million-us-jobs.html">an article</a> that has nothing to do with gender but rather the US economy. 2.2 million jobs is only 1.4% of the total number of jobs but I think there's more to it than just jobs. We don't know how much debt zombie companies are in for. And the other thing is the stock market - how can it have soared so high in year with high unemployment and reduced consumer spending?</p>
<p>A crash is coming in 2021! I don't know how bad it will be exactly but something seems completely fucked up. I can already see it coming for the company I work for. They're doomed! I can see it in the stimulus checks we're all getting. Better hold on to that cash! When shit hits the fan real estate is going to be cheap as hell (I'm planning on capitalizing on it). Unemployment rates will get worse and continue getting worse for a couple of years. The US will go into a civil war. It will only end with many deaths and government + media reform. No one trusts politicians and they can't keep up with modern day technology or civil rights issues. The media is out of control. The rich will get super-rich and then dip out. The Great Depression part 2 is about to drop.</p>

    <h2>I'm back motherfuckers</h2>
    <time datetime="12/2/2020 6:07:44 AM +00:00">Published on Wed, 02 Dec 2020 06:07:44 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>It's been a long time. The world has changed a lot. It's gotten more stupid. That's partly why I'm back.</p>
<p>I rarely watch the news but I saw a pandemic update on YouTube today that I decided to watch because it was only 2 minutes long. They flashed some numbers up on the screen...</p>
<ul>
<li>13.3 million Americans got COVID</li>
<li>266 thousand have died from it</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds scary right?</p>
<p>Not really. I looked up the US population which is 328.2 million. That means only 4% of the US got COVID. Only 2% of the people that got it died which is .08% of the US population. It's mostly old people and unhealthy people who die.</p>
<p>So what the fuck is everyone scared of? Live a healthy life you dumb shits. You can't stop time or aging. Fuck all of you mask wearing ninjas!</p>
<p>I hear there is a vaccine coming out. Actually there are a couple of them because each pharma company is developing their own. What kind of moron would take that shit? My ex got multiple sclerosis from a tetanus shot. Fuck that. I'll wait till version 5000 of the CVOID vaccine comes out before I take it.</p>
<p>I have more shit to say about the world but I'm going to save it for another day now that I'm back. Enjoy!</p>
