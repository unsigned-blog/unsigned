    <h2>The US is About to Get Fucked</h2>
    <time datetime="1/5/2021 3:16:55 AM +00:00">Published on Tue, 05 Jan 2021 03:16:55 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sometimes I watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ctsJZ2aD1nCexfqj342NQ">this YouTube channel</a>. It's mostly about MGTOW and I watch it even though I'm not MTGOW (obviously if you've read any of my previous posts), but the guy thinks rationally and I like getting a wide perspective of worldviews in order to form my own. Recently he posted <a href="https://youtu.be/zBPJT4z9I3w?t=300">this video</a> in which he mentions <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/highly-indebted-zombie-companies-control-more-than-2-million-us-jobs.html">an article</a> that has nothing to do with gender but rather the US economy. 2.2 million jobs is only 1.4% of the total number of jobs but I think there's more to it than just jobs. We don't know how much debt zombie companies are in for. And the other thing is the stock market - how can it have soared so high in year with high unemployment and reduced consumer spending?</p>
<p>A crash is coming in 2021! I don't know how bad it will be exactly but something seems completely fucked up. I can already see it coming for the company I work for. They're doomed! I can see it in the stimulus checks we're all getting. Better hold on to that cash! When shit hits the fan real estate is going to be cheap as hell (I'm planning on capitalizing on it). Unemployment rates will get worse and continue getting worse for a couple of years. The US will go into a civil war. It will only end with many deaths and government + media reform. No one trusts politicians and they can't keep up with modern day technology or civil rights issues. The media is out of control. The rich will get super-rich and then dip out. The Great Depression part 2 is about to drop.</p>

    <h2>I'm back motherfuckers</h2>
    <time datetime="12/2/2020 6:07:44 AM +00:00">Published on Wed, 02 Dec 2020 06:07:44 GMT</time>

        <p>It's been a long time. The world has changed a lot. It's gotten more stupid. That's partly why I'm back.</p>
<p>I rarely watch the news but I saw a pandemic update on YouTube today that I decided to watch because it was only 2 minutes long. They flashed some numbers up on the screen...</p>
<ul>
<li>13.3 million Americans got COVID</li>
<li>266 thousand have died from it</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds scary right?</p>
<p>Not really. I looked up the US population which is 328.2 million. That means only 4% of the US got COVID. Only 2% of the people that got it died which is .08% of the US population. It's mostly old people and unhealthy people who die.</p>
<p>So what the fuck is everyone scared of? Live a healthy life you dumb shits. You can't stop time or aging. Fuck all of you mask wearing ninjas!</p>
<p>I hear there is a vaccine coming out. Actually there are a couple of them because each pharma company is developing their own. What kind of moron would take that shit? My ex got multiple sclerosis from a tetanus shot. Fuck that. I'll wait till version 5000 of the CVOID vaccine comes out before I take it.</p>
<p>I have more shit to say about the world but I'm going to save it for another day now that I'm back. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Frosted Tips</h2>
    <time datetime="12/4/2019 8:11:01 PM +00:00">Published on Wed, 04 Dec 2019 20:11:01 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Picking up from where I left off last week... Sunday's date was the only one I went on. The one on Monday that I was really excited about cancelled on me. Tuesday's girl ghosted me until a few days after Thanksgiving with a &quot;Happy Thanksgiving&quot; text which was intentionally late - that's the end of that. I was all set for Wednesday but I didn't like the girl that much and it was time to put my dick in her so I cancelled. Haven't talked to her since.</p>
<p>Car sex girl has been texting me regularly. She's a bit older than me, newly divorced, has kids, and is well off. I thought she just wanted to hook up but she's been texting me regularly every day asking about how my day is going. Then yesterday we were setting up a date for tomorrow and she asked me if we were hanging out at her place or going out for drinks... which I am pretty sure was a test. I think she really likes me and wants a relationship but is just playing it cool. So tomorrow we are going out on an actual date - an activity that should be fairly short but interesting and then dinner and drinks after. I'm picking her up (and dropping her off) so I'm sure we'll end up doing the nasty again at her place. I think I'll keep up the fun factor with her but throw in some important questions every so often. Not sure if she is girlfriend material yet so might as well start that process now.</p>
<p>Monday I am going out with this one chick that I met one time about six months ago. She is loopy as fuck so I'm not expecting anything to come of it... other than maybe hooking up. Yesterday she sent me a video of her licking an ice cream cone. She was trying to be sexy but I couldn't stop laughing. It was so lame! I guess some guys love it... and I'm sure she sent it to her trove of groupies that would nut in a heartbeat and give her endless amounts of attention. Suckers!</p>
<p>I think we've hit the mark where if you haven't found someone for the holidays then it will be tough going until January. There's a bunch of matches in my dating app but I'm not expecting to meet up with any of them. Besides I don't even know if I will have time. My schedule is getting busy.</p>
<p>Needless to say I am out of the depressed state I was in a few weeks ago. I knew it was only temporary but am happy that it's over. I do still think of my (ex?) wife. We separated 11 months ago and have been trying to work through the divorce since that time as well. She still wants to be together but for certain reasons that just won't work. I don't trust her at all. When I think of her I miss her and wish we were still together. I don't know if anyone will ever know me as well as she knows me. It's hard to imagine someone else filling in that place in my life again. I want it though. It's just going to be a lot of work and patience. What if I commit to someone who ends up hurting me? I don't want to waste my time or get hurt again.</p>
<p>I titled the posted Frosted Tips because I got a new driver's license (with a new picture) and it looks like I have &quot;frosted tips&quot; in my hair. My last license picture looked like that as well. Maybe it's something with the camera they use or the lighting but I definitely do not have frosted tips. Also it's Winter now, so it's a play on words. Kinda.</p>
<p>Last week I went searching through a backup of my old blog. This stuff is about 15 years old... and the comments people wrote were hilarious! So, I am thinking of adding comments to this blog as well. I just need to find a comment service that will allow anonymous comments because they're more fun that way. We'll see.</p>

    <h2>Dating is Fucking Weird</h2>
    <time datetime="11/27/2019 6:51:29 AM +00:00">Published on Wed, 27 Nov 2019 06:51:29 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>My dates this week have been weird as fuck...</p>
<p>Sunday, the date I didn't think would lead to anything ended up with me banging her in my car outside the restaurant. I can remember the last time I banged in a car but it's not common. Feels like a thing only high school kids do. I guess it went well enough because she wanted more today and I obliged. It was at her house though and a lot more comfortable... must be a million dollar house so, yeah. Wants to do it again next week, after the Thanksgiving holiday... so looks like I found myself a new fuck buddy. She's a little bit older than me but smoking hot, recently divorced, and loaded. It had been over two months since the last time for me so I'm happy about ending that drought.</p>
<p>Monday, the one I was <em>really</em> looking to, ended up flaking. Something about her not feeling well because she got a flu shot a few days before. It's believable I suppose but what I suspect happened was that she did some research on me and found out about some shit. It's not true but it doesn't look good. If I was a woman I would cancel on me too. What am I going to say though? There's no good way of bringing it up. She said she still wanted to meet and would reschedule... but it's been a day and haven't heard back after I replied with an understanding message. I'm disappointed about it but it's not the end of the world.</p>
<p>Tuesday, I was supposed to go out with a woman I had dated about five months ago. We had been texting all weekend and seemed like it was going well. She was definitely DTF but when I tried to confirm the date the day before I never got a reply. Strange that two dates got cancelled in a row.</p>
<p>Wednesday, I confirmed plans with the chick but I think I might cancel. It will be the fourth date with her. I'm not feeling it. She's been flirting pretty hard and the date will for sure lead to sex. Despite the attitude I display for women and sex in this post/blog I do still need to feel a connection - it's not just about boning. I need to feel a connection with the other person. If not then I just can't do it. I'm not a teenager any more and my erections are less consistent than they once were. Plus it's just not right or fair. So that's why I might cancel. I don't think I can get there with her. If I do go on it then it'll either be do-or-die on the date. If I'm still not feeling it then I'll have to tell her then, otherwise, it will go down. Ugh.</p>
<p>I have one date prospect lined up for the weekend after Thanksgiving... on Sunday. I've been out with her twice already. Super cool chick, cute, has a good career and all that stuff. Hoping it actually happens. The flakiness is getting old. we'll see. Until then I hope everyone has a great Turkey Day and spends lots of quality time with their friends and family!</p>

    <h2>Gender Equality</h2>
    <time datetime="11/26/2019 6:23:51 AM +00:00">Published on Tue, 26 Nov 2019 06:23:51 GMT</time>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I saw a video the other day on gender equality in sports where a coach was talking about reasons why women should have the same opportunities as men. Not only in sports but in the workplace and politics. I am pretty tired of this bullshit. I'm all for equal rights but there are reasons why women aren't equal to men.</p>
<p>I was prepared to write a long post about this but... It all boils down to <em>sex</em>. If women want to be truly equal then science will have to find a way to replace sex and companionship completely. It would have to be better than it is today, which will be <em>extremely hard</em> to do. Did I just make a pun? ...anyways, good luck with that, Science!</p>
